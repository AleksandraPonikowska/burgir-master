# Burgir Master

## Overview
Welcome to Burgir Master, a word game built with Ruby and Ruby2D. In this game, you take on the role of a chef at a burger bar, serving customers by completing their orders. Each customer presents their order with a Polish syllable in a speech bubble above them. Your task is to serve the correct Polish word that contains the given syllable.

## Objective and Mechanics
The objective of Word Chef is to score as many points as possible before the time runs out. Points are earned by correctly providing words that contain the requested syllable. Each correct word extends your time, while failing to serve customers in time reduces it.

## How to Play
1. **Start the Game**: Launch the game to begin serving customers.
2. **View Orders**: Customers will appear with a speech bubble displaying a Polish syllable.
3. **Serve Customers**: Type in a valid Polish word that includes the given syllable.
4. **Score Points**: Correct words will earn points and extend your remaining time.
5. **Avoid Penalties**: Failing to serve customers in time will decrease your remaining time.
